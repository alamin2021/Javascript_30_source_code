1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,630
All righty.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:08,080
So the first thing you're going to do is be sure to download the template for this project from the

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,680
course.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,760
And once you've unzipped it, you're now where I'm at now.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,570
And I'm just going to go about renaming this, removing the template part to show that I am now going

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,610
to actively work on the project.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:31,960
So the next step will be to open this in visual studio code so we can see that we have an MP for file

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,350
here.

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,470
This is a video background file that I've added.

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,730
And you can see that I've also added some CSF as well.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,640
The very first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna focus on adding a video background.

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:52,170
So the following explanation would be relevant for any project you want to add a video background to.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,150
If you don't want to add a video background to this project and you want to just add a background image

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:04,930
or a background color, you can just remove this video background, CSX from the template and you can

15
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,760
skip ahead to the next video.

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,360
But if you are interested in learning about adding a video background and making it mobile responsive,

17
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,520
I'm going to explain that now.

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,420
So there are a lot of options out there for stock video, but the one that I'm going to show you is

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,030
PIC's eBay.

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,820
This is one that I like to use.

21
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,290
It has a lot of great footage and a lot of free options as well.

22
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,130
So if you scroll down, you're just gonna pick a video that you like.

23
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,250
I'm gonna go with this first one here, this Mountain View.

24
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,320
When you click on it, you can see here we have the option to download the video.

25
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,360
And when we click on that, we can see that we have some different quality sizes here.

26
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,200
So you have four K of ten, eighty and 720.

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:56,800
I usually go with 720 for video backgrounds because I will often put a video overlay over them.

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,010
So that will mask any kind of lack of quality.

29
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,970
And we also want our videos to be as small as possible so that our Web site loads quickly.

30
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,510
We can see that this 720 video is still 5.2 megabytes, which is pretty big.

31
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:21,220
So if we download that video, we can actually compress it a little bit further using the Web site.

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,620
You compress dot com.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,480
Again, I'll provide a link for this within the course.

34
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,620
We're going to start by simply selecting our file.

35
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,510
And we're going to upload the file and compress just that simple.

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,570
So if you remember, our file size was five megabytes and we can see now that we've reduced the file

37
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,670
size by 70 percent.

38
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,700
So now our file size is only one point five megabytes, which I think is very good.

39
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:51,450
Awesome.

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,840
We have our videophone now.

41
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,570
So for our purposes, I've already added a video file within the course and I've taken it a step further.

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:06,990
And I've edited the file to allow it to play forwards and then backwards so that the infinite loop of

43
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,390
the video looks more seamless.

44
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,000
So that file size for that time video is also one point five megabytes.

45
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,740
So it is very small.

46
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,090
So once we have all that sorted out, we can jump back into our code.

47
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,850
And we're going to add to our each team at the top here.

48
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,050
We're going to comment on a title for our video background.

49
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,020
And we're going to have a video element here.

50
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,910
We're going to use the autocomplete to add the class of.

51
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,590
Video dash background.

52
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,750
We're actually going to use another element for our source within our video.

53
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,050
But we also want to set a few attributes on this as well.

54
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,510
So we want our video to loop and be muted and auto play.

55
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,470
So this is because we want it to be a constant video background.

56
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,820
That's why we want it on a loop.

57
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:10,700
We wanted to play right away as the page loads and the browser rules state, if you're going to play

58
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,330
a video.

59
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,920
It has to be muted.

60
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,560
So that's why we have our muted attribute there as well inside of this video.

61
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:28,450
We're going to add in our source element and we're gonna give this as our C attribute of time, that

62
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,620
MP for so you see that pretty populated for us.

63
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,230
And then below that, we're going to add in.

64
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,030
A div with the class of video overlay.

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,610
So this is going to be a transparent layer.

66
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,230
That's over top of our video.

67
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,290
As I said, it's going to hide any imperfections.

68
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,720
So let's just save that there.

69
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,160
And we're going to launch the project with our lives server extension.

70
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,300
Okay, so that's looking all right, but I know for a fact that the whole clock is visible in the video,

71
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,000
so we're gonna need to adjust some styling.

72
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,540
So back in our see assess, you can see that I've included some styling already.

73
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,840
And specifically for our video background.

74
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,960
So we have position fixed, meaning that on a site where we're scrolling through, we want the background

75
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,420
to always be in one place and we're going to anchor it to the bottom right corner of the page.

76
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:35,090
We will need to add a width of one hundred VW so that stance or viewport with that is the entire width

77
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,310
of the displayed window.

78
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,330
And we're gonna add a height property of auto.

79
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,330
So let's save that and check it out.

80
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,360
OK, so that's definitely looking better.

81
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,930
We have the whole video now and the whole clock.

82
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,380
But if we check on our mobile view.

83
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:04,510
We can see that this doesn't work at all because we have a horizontal video and we have a vertical screen

84
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:11,590
size here, so we're gonna go back to our CSX and we're going to go to the bottom where I've actually

85
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,900
already created a media query for you.

86
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,890
So this is designed for a large smartphone vertical.

87
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,380
So anything less than a max width of 600 pixels will apply these styles.

88
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,960
Remember that all media queries need to be at the bottom because they need to have the last word on

89
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,540
changing the class properties.

90
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:37,900
So for our video background, we're going to have a height of one hundred VH.

91
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:44,470
This time, instead of a height of auto and just explicitly we'll write out one hundred VW, even though

92
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,580
we're not changing that.

93
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,430
Just to make it easier to see what's happening.

94
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,270
OK.

95
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:55,510
And below that, we still need to do one other thing, and that is for our video itself.

96
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:02,350
We're going to need to add in an object fit property and we're going to use object fit cover.

97
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:10,570
So the object fit property allows you to make sure that a picture or a video fits whatever container

98
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,150
it's in without being distorted.

99
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,480
So let's save that and check it out.

100
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,040
OK.

101
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,410
So we can see that we've filled up the screen, which is great, but we can see that our clock now is

102
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,000
kind of off the page.

103
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,760
So we want that clock to be more in the center.

104
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:36,980
We can fix that using the styling object position alongside our object fit.

105
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:44,330
And you could enter in a horizontal and vertical value to shift the video position within the frame.

106
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,690
But in our case, we only need to shift it horizontally.

107
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,730
So we're only going to add one value and that value is going to be 70 percent.

108
00:07:53,540 --> 00:08:00,710
So if we save that now and check it out, we can see that we have our clock centered nicely in our mobile

109
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,220
view.

110
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,600
OK.

111
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,860
That is awesome.

112
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,260
The very last thing is going to be to add the overlay that I mentioned previously.

113
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:17,180
The other reason for adding an overlay is so that it's easier to have this be a background image and

114
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,510
still read everything that is within the foreground.

115
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,660
So if we scroll back up to the top.

116
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,250
We can see that we already have a class again for our video overlay in a similar way.

117
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,050
It is fixed position anchored in the top left corner.

118
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:40,830
We're going to need to add a height of one hundred v h so V for height.

119
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,920
So the entire height of the window and we're going to do a similar thing.

120
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,240
One hundred viewport with.

121
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,750
And then we're going to need to actually add a background color to actually have it look like something.

122
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,660
We're going to use an RGV a value.

123
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,070
And in this case, I'm going to use white.

124
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,860
But you could use black or any other color.

125
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,560
And for the A. which stands for Alpha, also kind of means opacity.

126
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm going to have point three five.

127
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,520
So that means it's 35 percent.

128
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,690
See through.

129
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,220
Let's say that and check it out.

130
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:20,840
OK.

131
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,320
So that allows everything to kind of fade a little bit more into the background.

132
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,330
And you can see if we were to have text here.

133
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,850
It would be a little easier to read because the yellow is not as bright as it was before.

134
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,030
So feel free to adjust as necessary.

135
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:39,830
The colors and opacity levels, especially if you're using a different video background on a different

136
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,400
project.

137
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,090
Oftentimes I have a black overlay instead of a white one.

138
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,750
But I thought that the white one works better in this case.

139
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,010
All right.

140
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,400
So in the next video, we'll continue creating the UI for our custom countdown project.

141
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,970
I'll see in that one.

142
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,200
Bye for now.
